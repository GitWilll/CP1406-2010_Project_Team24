<h2>Performer Obligations</h2>
        
<p>You will need a repertoire to fill 60 to 90 minutes, arranged and rehearsed so that it flows smoothly. Clothing, uniforms or costumes should be appropriate to the style of music.</p>
<p>Let us know the proposed date of your concert as early as possible, preferably 3 months before the event (all the major venues are heavily booked and many theatre bookings are made 2 years ahead!). All the information for ticket sales and advertising should be ready 5 weeks before the event. The TicketShop receives many enquiries from members of the public, so as soon as the event is listed on their database they will require details of the content of the proposed concert along with start time, interval time, finish
time, ticket prices, etc.</p>
<p>Technical requirements, e.g. stage layout, sound, lighting, access times, etc, should be determined at least 3 weeks before the event to allow for rostering of theatre staff.</p>

<p>Also required is the confidence and commitment to see it through - it costs money to cancel a concert! If
you cancel the concert, the Music Centre may seek to recover from you expenses already committed plus
expenses incurred because of the cancellation.</p>
<p>To receive payment from the proceeds of your concert, you will asked to provide an invoice quoting an
Australian Business Number. If you do not have an ABN, you may be asked to complete a “Statement
by a Supplier” form to avoid having funds withheld for taxation.</p>
        
<h3>Music Centre Obligations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Music Centre will book the venue for your concert date if possible.</li>
    <li>The Music Centre will arrange appropriate contracts with the Townsville City Council and TicketShop and pay any security deposit required.</li>
<li>The Music Centre will provide Public Liability Insurance and Volunteer Workers Personal Accident
    Cover for the event.</li>
<li>The Music Centre will assist with technical specification so that the venue is set up as required.</li>
<li>The Music Centre will provide a bulk email service, promotion of the event on the TicketShop and
Music Centre websites, and will provide contact information for news media.</li>
<li>After the event, the Music Centre will finalise the contracts with the Townsville City Council and
TicketShop and provide a summary of all receipts and expenses. </li>
<li>Unless other financial arrangements are negotiated, the Music Centre will retain funds to cover expenses
and forward any surplus to the performer.</li>
</ul>
        
<h4>Promotion of your Concert</h4>
<p> provide about 300 to 500 words about your group, the history of your organisation, individual
performers, or the content of your concert along with good-quality photos suitable for a newspaper
article, journalists and editors are more likely to publish a major feature in their editorial pages, which
will be far more effective than any normal advertising. Photos for this purpose need to be in the original
camera format, not compressed or reduced in any way. This also applies to photos used on posters. The
Music Centre can easily produce copies of the photos suitable for websites, Facebook and email. </p>
<p>A short text of 150 to 200 words describing the performers and the performance are required for our
website, the TicketShop website and our bulk email. An even shorter text of less than 50 words is
required for listing on the Civic Theatre’s calendars and flyers and the Community Information Centre’s
    Arts e-Bulletin.</p>
<p>Television and radio stations also provide free promotion of our events, but they need 2 to 3 weeks’
notice. ABC Local Radio and 4TTT may offer on-air interviews and sometimes live on-air
    performances.</p>
        
<h5>Planning your Concert</h5>
<p>A professionally-managed venue will have a standard configuration, which will typically have a floor plan
and information about seating, stage, sound, lighting, bar and catering, etc. If you stick to the standard
configuration you will minimise costs.</p>
<p>If you want to change the configuration you will be responsible for any costs incurred in the change, and
you will also be responsible for returning the venue to its standard configuration. Some venues will allow
you to do some of this work; most will charge you for some or all of it. You may also be charged an
extra fee for any equipment that is not included in the standard hire charge.</p>
<p>Pianos require special consideration, because they are vulnerable to damage when moved or lifted.
Moving a piano a short distance over a smooth flat floor usually causes no problem, but lifting it onto a
raised stage requires manpower and/or lifting equipment. Grand pianos are particularly vulnerable. Most
venues do not permit their grand piano to be lifted and require it to be tuned after any significant
movement. Once a piano has been moved into position and tuned, it should not be moved again before
the performance.</p>
<p>The standard hire charge may apply for the whole day, but the venue management may require payment
    for at least one person to be on duty for all the hours that you are actually present.</p>
<p>The compere, stage manager, sound and lighting operators and even the ushers all contribute to the
success of your show. Please don’t spring any surprises on them. If you want to do something
unorthodox or “unexpected” then it all needs to be carefully planned and, if possible, rehearsed.</p>
